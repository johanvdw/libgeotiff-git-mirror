		ODBC2CSV
		========


The GeoTIFF CSV files are derived from the EPSG database kept in Microsoft
Access format.  To recreate the CSV files with the most recent EPSG database
do the following steps:

1) Download the database:

   http://www.epsg.org/

2) In the ODBC manager (in the Windows Control Panel) add a datasource called
   EPSG for the EPSG .mdb file.

3) Recompile ODBC2CSV (if odbc2csv.exe isn't provided here) using the
   local makefile (should be VC 5.0 and NMAKE compatible). 

4) Run dumpepsg.bat

Your done! Copy the new CSV files over the old ones. 


The ODBC2CSV program can be used to dump any ODBC supported table to a 
CSV file with a clean escaping mechanism.  The odbc2csv.cpp program is
mine, and the rest is derived from work by Dave Merner (dave@merge.net).
